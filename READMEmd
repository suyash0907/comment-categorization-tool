💬 Comment Categorization & Reply Assistant📌 Project OverviewThis tool is an AI-powered application designed to help content creators and community managers efficiently handle user feedback. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze comments and categorize them into 8 distinct intents (such as Praise, Hate, or Constructive Criticism). It also generates empathetic, context-aware reply suggestions.🎯 Key FeaturesSmart Classification: Distinguishes between similar categories (e.g., differentiating "Hate" from Constructive Criticism).Reply Assistant: Suggests appropriate responses based on the sentiment (e.g., thanking for praise, acknowledging criticism).Visual Analytics: Displays a dynamic Pie Chart showing the distribution of comment types.Batch Processing: Allows users to upload a CSV file to categorize hundreds of comments instantly.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xMachine Learning: Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF Vectorization)Web Interface: StreamlitData Manipulation: PandasVisualization: Plotly Express🚀 How to Run the Project1. Install DependenciesOpen your terminal/command prompt and run:pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Train the ModelBefore running the app, you must train the AI model. This script reads the dataset, trains the classifier, and saves the model as comment_model.pkl.python train.py
Current Performance:Training Accuracy: ~97.28%Test Set Accuracy: ~55-60% (Expected for small datasets)3. Launch the ApplicationStart the web interface:streamlit run app.py
The application will open in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).📂 Project StructureFileDescriptionapp.pyThe main application code containing the Streamlit UI and logic.train.pyThe machine learning script.

Suggests blocking/reporting.🟡 Yellow Alert: For Constructive Criticism. Suggests taking notes for improvement.🟢 Green Status: For Praise, Support, etc. Suggests engaging positively.📈 Future ImprovementsExpand the dataset to 1000+ rows to improve test-set generalization.Integrate a Deep Learning model (like BERT) for even higher nuance detection.Add a "Download Report" PDF feature.
